 * Client-Server Interaction
 * The client side must take care of the parameters to be passed once requesting any metric.
 * The process at the client side will follow the given steps:
 * 1) Initiate connection with the server over Command Socket
 * 2) Authenticate based on the server requirements.
 * 3) Receive the parameters for Data Socket and connect to that after authentication.
 * 4) Pass the requests to the server
 * 5) Receive the hash value of the file on the Command socket
 * 6) Receive the files over the Data socket
 * 7) Confirm if the hash value corresponds to the file
 * 8) Request retransmit from the server if mismatch between hash value and file or failure to
 * receive file (Relevant String should be displayed in terminal). A scenario for this step
 * may be specifically designed for demonstration purposes.)
 * 9) Display the files in the appropriate manner.
 * 10) Terminate the connection in case an appropriate file is received and no other request
 * forwarded within the timeout duration. (Appropriate tests for demonstration purposes
 * should be developed.)
